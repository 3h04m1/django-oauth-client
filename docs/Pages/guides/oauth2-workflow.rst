Oauth2 workflow
++++++++++++++++

The OAuth2 workflow is a bit more complex than the OAuth1 workflow. It
involves a few more steps and a few more HTTP requests. The main
difference is that the OAuth2 workflow is designed to be used by
clients that can keep a secret, such as a web application or a
desktop application. The OAuth1 workflow is designed to be used by
clients that cannot keep a secret, such as a mobile application.
